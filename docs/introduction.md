# Introduction to Sylius REST API

This part of the documentation is about RESTful JSON/XML API for the Sylius platform.

### **Note**

This documentation assumes you have at least some experience with [REST APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

### **Tip**

We strongly recommend starting with our basic guide to Sylius API in the Cookbook: [How to use Sylius API?](https://docs.sylius.com/en/latest/cookbook/api/api.html).
